Homework week 5

There are some low count of timepoints, what are the qualifications for all to have 10? It would be fun to see who had more mouse that sucessfully completed the treatment.

It was intersting to see that there was a correlation between the Tumor Weight and the Mouse weight. Because then we could look at the data differently, do the avg mouse and avg start of Tumor weight compared to final tumor weight and mouse weight. Do the Drugs with the lowest Final Tumor Volume already had small tumors? 

The Drug, Ramicane, has a lower range of Final Tumor Volume compared to the other drugs. It would be intersting to see if it had a significant drop from the avg start of Tumor Volume. Would this mean that this is the most successful Drug trial? I think that there are several other factors that we would need to look into. I saw that some didnt have that much timepoints, does this mean the drug failed and the mouse was not able to sucessfully complete the trial?
